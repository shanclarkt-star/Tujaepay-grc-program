# Inherent vs Residual Risk

## Purpose
This document explains how TujaePay differentiates between inherent risk and residual risk as part of its enterprise risk management (ERM) program.

## Definitions

### Inherent Risk
Inherent risk is the level of risk present before any controls or mitigation measures are applied. It reflects the raw exposure associated with a process, system, or activity.

### Residual Risk
Residual risk is the level of risk remaining after controls have been implemented. This reflects the effectiveness of mitigating controls.

---

## Risk Evaluation Criteria
Risks are evaluated based on:
- Likelihood (Low / Medium / High)
- Impact (Low / Medium / High)

The combination of likelihood and impact determines the overall risk rating.

---

## Example Risk Scenario

### Risk Description
Unauthorized access to production systems containing customer data.

### Inherent Risk Assessment
- Likelihood: Medium
- Impact: High
- Inherent Risk Rating: High

### Mitigating Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Quarterly access reviews
- Centralized logging and monitoring

### Residual Risk Assessment
- Likelihood: Low
- Impact: High
- Residual Risk Rating: Medium

---

## Risk Acceptance
Residual risks exceeding TujaePay’s defined risk tolerance must be reviewed and approved by executive management.

## Review Cycle
Inherent and residual risks are reviewed annually or when significant changes occur.
