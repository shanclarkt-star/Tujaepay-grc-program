# Risk Assessment Methodology

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define TujaePay’s standardized methodology for identifying,
assessing, and managing risks across the organization. This methodology supports consistent,
repeatable, and risk-based decision-making.

---

## 2. Scope
This methodology applies to:
- Information security risks
- Compliance and regulatory risks
- Operational risks
- Third-party risks
- Technology and cloud infrastructure risks

Risk assessments apply to systems, processes, vendors, and business activities.

---

## 3. Risk Identification
Risks are identified through:
- Internal audits and assessments
- Vendor risk assessments
- Incident response activities
- Changes in systems, processes, or vendors
- Regulatory or legal changes
- Threat intelligence and monitoring

Each identified risk is documented in the TujaePay Risk Register.

---

## 4. Risk Assessment Criteria

Risks are evaluated using two primary factors:

### Likelihood
The probability that a risk event will occur.

- Low: Unlikely to occur
- Medium: Possible occurrence
- High: Likely or frequent occurrence

### Impact
The potential business impact if the risk occurs.

- Low: Minimal operational impact
- Medium: Moderate disruption or financial impact
- High: Significant business, regulatory, or reputational impact

---

## 5. Inherent Risk Determination
Inherent risk represents the level of risk before any controls are applied.

Inherent Risk is determined by combining likelihood and impact ratings using a qualitative risk matrix.

---

## 6. Control Identification
For each identified risk, existing controls are documented, including:
- Policies and procedures
- Technical controls
- Monitoring and detection mechanisms
- Contractual or administrative controls

Controls are evaluated for design and effectiveness.

---

## 7. Residual Risk Determination
Residual risk represents the remaining risk after controls are applied.

Residual risk is reassessed by evaluating:
- Control effectiveness
- Coverage gaps
- Operating consistency

Residual risk must fall within TujaePay’s defined risk tolerance.

---

## 8. Risk Rating Levels

| Risk Rating | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Low | Acceptable risk; no immediate action required |
| Medium | Risk requires monitoring and planned mitigation |
| High | Risk requires immediate mitigation or escalation |

---

## 9. Risk Treatment Options
Risks are managed using one or more of the following strategies:

- Mitigate: Implement controls to reduce risk
- Accept: Formally accept risk within tolerance
- Transfer: Transfer risk through contracts or insurance
- Avoid: Discontinue the risky activity

Risk acceptance must be approved by management when required.

---

## 10. Risk Ownership and Accountability
Each risk is assigned a risk owner responsible for:
- Monitoring the risk
- Implementing mitigation actions
- Reporting status updates

---

## 11. Risk Documentation and Tracking
All risks are:
- Documented in the Risk Register
- Assigned an owner and status
- Reviewed periodically
- Tracked until mitigation or acceptance

High-risk items are escalated to leadership.

---

## 12. Review and Maintenance
Risk assessments are conducted:
- Annually
- Upon significant system or process changes
- Following security incidents
- When new vendors are onboarded

This methodology is reviewed annually and updated as needed.
